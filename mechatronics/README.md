# mechatronics
This folder contains code listings related to the final project
in Mechatronics.  Essentially, we built a microcontroller-based
robot from scratch, integrating motors, sensors, and electronics
into a fully functional robot that could move and shoot ping-pong
balls at another robot.  This involved writing C-code for the 
HCS12 family of microcontrollers by Freescale, which included a state
machine as well as sensor interfacing (IR beacon receiver, transmitter, etc.),
and motor interfacing.
